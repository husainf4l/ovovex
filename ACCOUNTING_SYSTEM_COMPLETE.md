## Key Features

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping
- Every transaction maintains debit = credit
- Automatic balance validation
- Prevent unbalanced entries

### Real-Time Calculations
- Account balances calculated on-the-fly
- Automatic aggregations for reports
- Dynamic ratio calculations

### Audit Trail
- Created by / Updated by tracking
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- Posted by tracking for journal entries
- Status change history

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints on codes/numbers
- Decimal precision for financial amounts (15,2)
- Required field validation

### Multi-Currency Ready
- Decimal field precision suitable for multiple currencies
- Extensible for currency conversion

## API Endpoints (Future Enhancement)

The system is structured to easily add REST API endpoints:
- GET /api/accounts/
- POST /api/journal-entries/
- GET /api/invoices/
- POST /api/payments/
- GET /api/reports/balance-sheet/
- GET /api/reports/profit-loss/

## Testing

### Quick Verification
```bash
# Check all data is seeded
python manage.py shell
>>> from accounting.models import *
>>> print(f"Accounts: {Account.objects.count()}")
>>> print(f"Customers: {Customer.objects.count()}")
>>> print(f"Invoices: {Invoice.objects.count()}")
>>> print(f"Journal Entries: {JournalEntry.objects.count()}")
```

### Test Account Balance
```bash
python manage.py shell
>>> from accounting.models import Account
>>> acc = Account.objects.get(code='1020')
>>> print(f"{acc.name}: ${acc.get_balance()}")
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**
   - Code fields (account_code, invoice_number, etc.)
   - Date fields (invoice_date, bill_date, etc.)
   - Status fields
   - Composite indexes for common queries

2. **Query Optimization**
   - `select_related()` for foreign keys
   - `prefetch_related()` for reverse relations
   - Aggregate queries for summations

3. **Caching Opportunities**
   - Account balances
   - Financial ratios
   - Report data

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All views protected with `@login_required`
   - User tracking on all create/update operations

2. **Data Validation**
   - Model-level validators
   - Positive amount validation
   - Date range validation
   - Balance validation

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Who created what and when
   - Who approved/posted transactions
   - Immutable posted entries
